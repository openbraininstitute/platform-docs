## Overview

Tracks costs for services; when a service is launched it either sends a message via SQS saying itâ€™s starting, and then when it ends or it uses an API call to do the same.
Future work: deploy multiple copies of this for HA.

## Goals

* Be able to break down costs at the `Project` level, as well as the `Virtual Lab` level.
* Be able to say 'how much credit is left, so that costs are capped to what the user has already paid for
  * Prior to a use of a cost incurring resource usage, the budget will be checked if there is enough money
